Back-and-forth exchanges using Google Translate proved slow and cumbersome, more hindering than helpful. Needing a swift, dependable, and secure tool and finding none that met my needs, I resolved to build it myself."

        "On the server side, a Node.js environment was chosen for its versatility and performance, handling real-time translations through the Google Translate API and interfacing with a SQL Server database on Azure for robust data management. This backend architecture not only supports full CRUD operations but does so through efficiently designed stored procedures in T-SQL, ensuring fast, secure, and reliable database interactions.",
