        "The Client Application is a React/Next.js app hosted on Vercel. The deployment is embedded within the Monday platform, along with interactive boards that display the order/product information dynamically populated by the API.",
        "When the user: 1) initiates an order using the Client; 2) changes the status of an order using the Orders board; or 3) adds/edits/deletes a product offering using the Products (fragrances) board, webhooks within Monday are triggered, sending the data to the API hosted on Heroku.",
        "Once an endpoint is hit, the API then leverages the ORM to perform CRUD via T-SQL Stored Procedures executed within the SQL Server database. The data displayed on the Monday boards is also mutated, ensuring consistency."
